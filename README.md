# README
SaveMore is an app that wants to help you save effortlessly.
It is currently in demo version purely to showcase its functionalities because bank APIs do not allow their APIs to be taken out of their sandbox.

## App functionalities
* Create an account and link it to a debit card, currents and savings account.

	* User goes through the process of authenicating their debit card with OTP.


* View all user transactions.

* Get a breakdown of your spendings and savings, and how much SaveMore has helped the user to save.


* SaveMore has 3 key savings plans â€” Rounding, Recurring and One-off: 

	* Rounding takes any transaction, rounds it off to the nearest whole number and puts the extra amount into the savings account.

	* Recurring allows the user to set an amount that they want to recurr monthly.

	* One-off investments is an easy way to make quick deposits into the savings account.


* Users can also make payment / transfer money to other accounts via the app.

	* In desktop version, user has to input amount, payee and their account.

	* In mobile version, user simply has to scan the QR code to make payments.

## Technical Considerations
* React on Rails, Webpack

* Javascript, Css

* Ajax, TextBelt API

* npm packages: MDBootstrap React, Chartkick, React-router, whatwg-fetch
